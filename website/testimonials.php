  <p>I want to thank you and Rachel for your time and all the effort you went to for me on that day and for giving me the confidence to stand firm.  I was stressed and disappointed not to get things settled, but that wasn't a reflection on either of you.  I was actually in awe while watching you both in action that day, and I got a lot out of the discussions afterward.

  <p>I can not thank the team at Leach Legal enough. Whilst going through a very stressful and overwhelming experience, Kylie at Leach Legals’ advice and professionalism was imperative in resolving and finalising my divorce matters. She gave me peace of mind, was amazing to deal with and I could not thank her and Bella enough for all their help and expertise. Highly recommend. Thanks to you both for everything. Couldn’t have achieved end outcomes without you!

  <p>I received a very professional service from Leach Legal throughout my legal matter. My lawyer was extremely knowledgeable, efficient, and addressed all matters promptly, with respectful communication and discussion with myself at all times. A firm I would highly recommend if you are after Lawyers who are personable, knowledgeable, and possess sound people skills to treat you in a respectful way focused on client-driven outcomes.

  <p>I am more than happy with the service I received from Leach Legal. I have no hesitation recommending Leach Legal to others and should I need anything further will definitely return.

My sincere thanks to the whole team for their assistance. I know my file was relatively simple but for me, the process was the most stressful situation in my life to date and I thank them for their patience and understanding.

  <p>Amazing!! I wish I had used you from the beginning. I probably would have saved $50k. You have everything. The other lawyers were simply milking me for the money and leading me up the garden path. Vince really showed me that I was on a losing wicket. He has been very straight and I appreciate it. It’s what I need. Tania has also been great. I’m really happy.

    <p>"Katie... you’ve been amazing since day 1 and I truly couldn’t have done this without you. Thank you for your patience in doing work across the world, your realistic and appropriate advice, and your kindness. I can’t wait to be back in Perth and hope to thank you in person. You’ve helped me change my life and gave me the courage to do so. When the time comes, I will definitely be recommending you to others!  All the best to you and all who have helped me even behind the scenes."

  <p>I am so grateful for everything Nicola and Jessica have done. They have both been wonderful. I wasn’t well emotionally when I came to you and by handing everything over to you guys meant that I was able to heal. It was a real blessing knowing that when I couldn’t cope, someone else was still getting on with the job that I couldn’t face. I don’t even know where to start – everything you did was brilliant. Everyone was wonderful. Your firm came highly recommended and from the time that I met Nicola I was filled with confidence. I really felt I could put my trust in everyone there. It didn’t matter who I spoke with – when I had a question - by the end of the phone call I felt reassured and confident that my matter was being looked after. My questions were answered in full and I never came away from a conversation - with anyone at Leach Legal - with any doubts. It’s a great feeling to be able to put your trust in people because you know they will get on with the job. The fortnightly billing is a brilliant scheme. I always knew where I was costs wise. My wife got her bill from her lawyers just the other day– she has to cough up $30K in one hit!!! That’s about a third of what she was paid out by me! She’s in shock. The girls at the front desk were so welcoming. I really felt cared for. I didn’t feel like I was just a number. I think that was the real key – I felt like a person not a client. I just haven’t got enough words to say how much I appreciate everything everyone has done. I will have no hesitation in recommending you.
