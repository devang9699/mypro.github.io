    In the Family Court, the best interests of the child are paramount. The Court must consider a number of factors when deciding where a child should live. The Court will consider the wishes and views of the children, but the weight given to these wishes will depend on the child’s level of maturity and understanding, and whether their views have been influenced by anybody else. There is no prescribed age at which children can decide for themselves. The older and more mature the child, the more weight is placed on their wishes
